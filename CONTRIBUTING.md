# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing to DiffMat! We will post a complete contributing guide in future updates as soon as possible.

In the interim, we welcome suggestions, discussions, bug reports, and feature requests based on a proper code of conduct (e.g., from [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)).
- Open an issue if you encounter any bugs, have questions about the existing implementation, or look forward to some practical, enhanced features.
- For potential research collaborations, reports of misuse or misconducted behaviors, and other correspondences, please send an email to **{beichen, liangs} at mit dot edu**.
